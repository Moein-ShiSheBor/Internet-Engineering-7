<!-- This is a JavaScript code snippet that adds an event listener to a form's submit event.
     When the form is submitted, the function checks the validity of the email, password, and phone input fields.
     If any of the input fields are invalid, an error message is displayed. 
     If all input fields are valid, the form is submitted and the submit button is disabled to prevent multiple submissions. -->

     Each input field is required, and has an associated error message span. When the form is submitted,
     the form data is validated using JavaScript. The form also contains a submit button, which triggers the form submission. -->
